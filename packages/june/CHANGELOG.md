### Patch Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/junebuild/june/pull/10) [`b83df35`](https://github.com/junebuild/june/commit/b83df356771e44818004562640f7e7ff4e476c6d) Thanks [@linyiru](https://github.com/linyiru)! - Render content markdown with @momiji-rs/sparkdown/gfm (wasm) instead of marked

  The content pipeline now renders `entry.html` via `@momiji-rs/sparkdown/gfm` — a WASI-free WebAssembly
  CommonMark + GFM renderer — replacing `marked`. Benchmarked on real docs (Bun): ~75× faster on small
  pages and ~580× faster on large pages (marked degrades super-linearly: a 27KB page took ~130ms; the
  same page renders in ~0.22ms), with GFM (tables, strikethrough, task lists, autolinks) at no extra
  cost. Output is CommonMark-strict: headings stay bare (`<h2>…`), code fences keep `language-*`, and a
  bare `{…}` is literal text. The wasm initializes once per process; this module is build/dev-only, so it
  never enters the worker bundle.
