### Patch Changes

- [`b3b6122`](https://github.com/junebuild/june/commit/b3b6122d68fe0ac68d8cb753bae07293b602eafd) Thanks [@linyiru](https://github.com/linyiru)! - Ship compiled JS + `.d.ts` from the remaining packages so plain Node can consume
  them too.

  Completes the dual-export rollout started with `@junejs/core`. `@junejs/db`,
  `@junejs/juno`, `@junejs/i18n`, `@junejs/og`, and `@junejs/cli` now build to
  `dist/` (ESM JS + `.d.ts`) via tsdown and use **dual-condition exports**:
  `source`/`bun` still serve `src/*.ts` (the zero-build inner loop, Bun, opt-in
  bundlers), while `default`/`types` serve built JS + declarations for Node and
  external `tsc`. Notes per package:

  - `@junejs/og` keeps its per-runtime backend selection — `workerd`/`edge-light`/
    `default` each map to the right built entry; the OG renderers (`workers-og`,
    `@vercel/og`) stay external so their WASM is never bundled.
  - `@junejs/cli` builds only its `.` export (`run(argv)`); the `june` bin still
    runs `src/june.ts` raw under Bun.

  `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING` is now closed across the whole
  workspace.

### Patch Changes

- [#18](https://github.com/junebuild/june/pull/18) [`ab62955`](https://github.com/junebuild/june/commit/ab62955bd3c5e68c95e2a752761a6bdba732e09c) Thanks [@linyiru](https://github.com/linyiru)! - Configurable content sources: `content.sources` in june.config.ts

  Content no longer has to live under `content/<collection>/`. Config can declare extra source
  directories — including ones outside the app root — that merge into named collections:

  ```ts
  export default defineJune({
    content: {
      sources: [
        { dir: "../docs", collection: "docs" }, // the repo's own docs/, docs-as-code
        { dir: "../schema", collection: "docs", mount: "schema" }, // slugs prefixed schema/…
      ],
    },
  });
  ```

  - Each source scans with the same locale-mirror layout as `content/` (`<dir>/<locale>/…`).
  - `mount` prefixes slugs; a source's root `index.md`/`README.md` becomes the mount's page.
  - A slug collision between sources fails `june gen` loudly, naming both files. A missing
    configured dir is a build error, not a silent skip.
  - Bootstrap-safe: a wrapper-generated config that imports `app/_content.ts` (which only exists
    AFTER the first freeze) self-heals — `june gen` generates the default scan, re-probes the
    config in a fresh subprocess, and regenerates with the sources applied.
  - `june dev` watches configured source dirs (they're outside the app root, invisible to the
    root watcher) and regenerates + restarts on change.
